---------- SCALA  ----------------
** Features of SCALA
1. Scala is an object oriented Language --Scala is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object.
2. Scala is an functional Language --Scala is also a functional language in the sense that every function is a value and every value is an object.
   so ultimately every function is an object.
3. Scala provides a lightweight syntax for defining anonymous functions,
4. It supports higher-order functions, it allows functions to be nested, and supports currying.
5. Scala runs on the JVM(Java Virtual Machine)
6. Scala is statically typed---Scala is a Statically typed language because once a type is assigned to a variable, it remains the same for the entire scope.

** VARIABLES IN SCALA
Variable is a Menory which is used to store the Data.
In scala there are two types of variables: 1.Mutable  2. Immutable
** Mutable Variables: These variables are those variables which allow us to change a value after the declaration of a variable.
    Mutable variables are defined by using the “var” keyword.
**  Immutable Variables: These variables are those variables which do not allow you to change a value after the declaration of a variable.
   Immutable variables are defined by using the “val” keyword.
